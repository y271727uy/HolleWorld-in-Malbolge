#  The Craziest Hello World Program in Malbolge！
A “Hello, World!” program written in Malbolge — arguably the most unreadable code ever created by humans. Malbolge is a language designed to torment programmers, and this project showcases its extreme absurdity and beauty.

No human has ever handwritten this code — it had to be generated by an algorithm.

⚠️ Since GitHub does not natively recognize the Malbolge language, this project uses a .gitattributes file to treat .mal files as Brainfuck, enabling approximate syntax highlighting.
